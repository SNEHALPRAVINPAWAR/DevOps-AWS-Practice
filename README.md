I recently focused on enhancing my skills in DevOps on AWS. I learned how to create a virtual server using an EC2 instance and accessed it through the PuTTY terminal. During this process, I practiced basic Linux commands for file management. Additionally, I successfully installed Java and Jenkins on the virtual server, which has provided me with a solid foundation in server management and continuous integration practices.

**S3 Bucket Learning**

As part of my AWS learning, I focused on Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to understand how cloud-based object storage works and how access to stored data can be controlled using IAM and bucket policies.

Key Concepts Covered:
- Creating and configuring an S3 bucket
- Uploading an HTML file (`login.html`) as an object
- Understanding public access settings and bucket-level permissions
- Granting object access using:
  - Object-level permissions
  - IAM user policies (JSON-based)
  - Bucket policy (JSON-based)
- Testing access from another IAM user
- Verifying access via direct URL in a browser (Chrome)


**Practiced Route 53**


In this section of the project, I explored Amazon Route 53 using both the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and Route 53 APIs. The goal was to understand how DNS management and domain routing are handled programmatically on AWS.

âœ… What Was Practiced :
-Creating a hosted zone using the Route 53 API
-Listing existing hosted zones
-Adding and listing DNS records (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.)
-Understanding hosted zone IDs and record formatting
-Deleting hosted zones and associated records
-Observing how Route 53 interacts with other services like EC2 and S3 when routing traffic





**AWS CLI Practice**

AWS CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage and interact with AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, and more directly from your terminal or scripts.

This repository contains my hands-on practice using the **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**. It includes:
- S3 bucket creation from the CLI
- Basic AWS CLI commands for common AWS services
- Understanding JSON output from CLI
