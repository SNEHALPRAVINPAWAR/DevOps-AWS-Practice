I recently focused on enhancing my skills in DevOps on AWS. I learned how to create a virtual server using an EC2 instance and accessed it through the PuTTY terminal. During this process, I practiced basic Linux commands for file management. Additionally, I successfully installed Java and Jenkins on the virtual server, which has provided me with a solid foundation in server management and continuous integration practices.
