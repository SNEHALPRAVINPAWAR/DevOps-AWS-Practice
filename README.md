I recently focused on enhancing my skills in DevOps on AWS. I learned how to create a virtual server using an EC2 instance and accessed it through the PuTTY terminal. During this process, I practiced basic Linux commands for file management. Additionally, I successfully installed Java and Jenkins on the virtual server, which has provided me with a solid foundation in server management and continuous integration practices.

**S3 Bucket Learning**

As part of my AWS learning, I focused on Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to understand how cloud-based object storage works and how access to stored data can be controlled using IAM and bucket policies.

Key Concepts Covered:
- Creating and configuring an S3 bucket
- Uploading an HTML file (`login.html`) as an object
- Understanding public access settings and bucket-level permissions
- Granting object access using:
  - Object-level permissions
  - IAM user policies (JSON-based)
  - Bucket policy (JSON-based)
- Testing access from another IAM user
- Verifying access via direct URL in a browser (Chrome)



**AWS CLI Practice**

AWS CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage and interact with AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, and more directly from your terminal or scripts.

This repository contains my hands-on practice using the **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**. It includes:
- S3 bucket creation from the CLI
- Basic AWS CLI commands for common AWS services
- Understanding JSON output from CLI
